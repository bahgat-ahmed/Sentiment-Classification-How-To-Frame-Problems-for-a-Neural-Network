This is a project I have implemented in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Udacity Nanodegree in the **Sentiment Analysis** extracurricular course in the Nanodegree.

The following is the guide written at the beginning of the notebook explaining the 6 small projects that form this Notebook. The details
are found in the Notebook.

### What You Should Already Know

- neural networks, forward and back-propagation
- stochastic gradient descent
- mean squared error
- and train/test splits
