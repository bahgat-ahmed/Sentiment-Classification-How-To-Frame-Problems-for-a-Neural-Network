# Sentiment-Classification-How-To-Frame-Problems-for-a-Neural-Network

This is a project I have implemented in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Udacity Nanodegree.

The following is the guide written at the beginning of the notebook explaining the 6 small projects that form this Notebook.

### What You Should Already Know

- neural networks, forward and back-propagation
- stochastic gradient descent
- mean squared error
- and train/test splits

### Where to Get Help if You Need it
- Re-watch previous Udacity Lectures
- Leverage the recommended Course Reading Material - [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) (Check inside your classroom for a discount code)
- Shoot me a tweet @iamtrask
